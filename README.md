# Document Object Model
### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
## THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
### As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes:
* THE DOCUMENT NODE 
* ELEMENT NODES 
* ATTRIBUTE NODES
* TEXT NODES
